# Robot-Personal-Assistant- "Follow Me Robot"
The "Follow Me" robot is a mobile robotic system designed to autonomously track and follow a target or user. Utilizing an ultrasonic sensor, it continuously measures the distance between itself and the target, adjusting its movement to maintain a safe and consistent following distance. Equipped with motorized wheels and motor drivers, it is capable of moving forward to pursue the target and stopping when the target is too close. The robot's behavior is governed by a microcontroller (such as Arduino Uno) that processes sensor data and controls motor movements accordingly. This versatile robot can be further enhanced with additional sensors and features to adapt to various environments and tasks, making it an ideal platform for applications such as surveillance, assistance, and entertainment.
